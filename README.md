# Portfolio

***Preamble***

This GitHub repo consists of a series of code-bases which I have created to demonstrate the types of projects that I enjoy coding and developing. My current interests pertain to building advanced analytics utilizing unstructured text processing methodologies (e.g NLP, NER, amongst others).

While much of my professional expertise surrounds traditional Java and .NET web-application creation/building/maintenance/etc., there are many powerful tools in the Python "universe" which align with my stated interests above.

The code in this repo is free to use, however I make no claims as its efficacy or whether it can be used within Production environments; it is merely for illustrative purposes and to provide context for how I would solve specific analysis problems. In other words, please feel free to use this code - but, do so at your own risk...

***Files in this Repository***

The first project in this repo is a Python 2.7-based project called 'DaoGenerator' which I created to generate SQL scripts and Java objects (utilizing Spring conventions) from a series of YAML files. This project represents my first foray into "polyglottal" code generation.
